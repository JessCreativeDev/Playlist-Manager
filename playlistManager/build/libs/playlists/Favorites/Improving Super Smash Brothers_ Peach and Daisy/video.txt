Video Name: Improving Super Smash Brothers: Peach and Daisy
Description: The princess we currently have in Smash Brothers feels like an amalgamation of Daisy and Peach, taking inspiration from the "damsel in distress" role that Peach is normally thrown into, while injecting some of Daisy's personality to ensure that it makes sense why Peach is fighting.

Which works!

But it's not Peach. Paper Peach, maybe, but the Princess we've all grown up with is nothing like the one in Smash Brothers. And now that Daisy is in the mix, she's also stuck with this bizarre moveset. And I'm not satisfied with that! So today we ask ourselves: What SHOULD Peach and Daisy look like in Super Smash Brothers?
