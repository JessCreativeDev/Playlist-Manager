LYRICS:
Today's the day!
The Console War has begun!
We're launching PS4
Against the XBox One!

We've got the best new games
And tons of indie support!
You mess with Sony, MS,
and yes, you'll come up short!

This is it!
Our console's ready for war!
Release the Xbox One
To ravage PS4!

We're packing Kinect 2
And armed with Xbox Live!
We'll port all Gamerscores
And unleash Halo 5!

This new Wii U's armed with tech to the teeth!
NFC touchscreen and more!
No other games claim the same fame or fun!
So who would pay more for PS4 or Xbox One!

DualShock has a touchpad
People love so much that
We've installed a button
Just to Share!

Evolving Achievements
Lead us to believe that
Xbox One has class to spare!

First strike was Nintendo's!
Batten down the Friend Codes!
Time to finally end those
Console Wars!

PS4
Will conquer One and Wii U
With its renewed support
It missed since PlayStation 2!

We aren't supporting used games-
-I mean, I guess they seem fine...
They must be played on the web-
...Okay, or stay offline...

Activate Add-ons and Lock on Party Games!
PSN Servers were hacked...  Again...
Deploying NFL, NHL widgetry galore!
And still, we're hardcore and far more prepped for this Console War!

Fancy specs!
Tech to spare!
Lots of apps!
-No one cares!

Change the name!
Stay the course!
Make great games until we
Win... the Console Wars!
