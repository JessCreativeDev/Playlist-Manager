Video Name: Heart of Lilith  -  Inkubus Sukkubus
Description: She has come from the shadows of the dream world
A dark angel from the darker side of love
Across a sea of tears
A hundred thousand years
Come with her and dance in the moon light
And you are lost to this world evermore
Put your hand in her hand

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
Your the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!

Come and drown in the lake of her passion
Come and die so you can be reborn
Hear the siren sing
Hear the death knell ring
She's a witch a siren and a vampyre
She has come from the distance stars
To take your heart
To break your heart

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
Your the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!

Come and kiss, kiss the lips of Lilith
Come and kiss and you will be no more
Feel the fire
Of desire

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
Your the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
Your the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith!
