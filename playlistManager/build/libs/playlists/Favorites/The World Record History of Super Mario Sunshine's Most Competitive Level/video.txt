Video Name: The World Record History of Super Mario Sunshine's Most Competitive Level
Description: In this video, I'm shifting gears from covering the history of full game runs to the history of a single level! Pianta's in Need (Episode 6 of Pianta Village) is the only level in Mario Sunshine that I feel is deserving of a formal video. For various reasons, this level has been extremely competitive ever since Sunshine's increase of popularity circa 2014. Nearly every Sunshine runner grinds this level from time to time, but only some of the most technical players of their era could leave a mark in world record fame!
