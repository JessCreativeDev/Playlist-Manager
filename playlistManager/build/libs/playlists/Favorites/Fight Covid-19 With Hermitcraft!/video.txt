Video Name: Fight Covid-19 With Hermitcraft!
Description: Folding@home uses the processor power of thousands of personal desktop computers all over the world to help analyze proteins for scientific research into diseases. Currently the organization is pushing hard to help untangle the mysteries of COVID-19. This research will be used to help develop medications, vaccines and treatment programs.

The Hermits have joined together in a Folding@Home team that you can join if you've got the CPU or GPU power to spare.

If you have a beefy desktop computer, consider downloading the Folding@Home software and donating your spare processor cycles to the cause. 

While the software is free, kids living with their parents should probably check with them first since there can be some increased electricity costs associated with allowing it to run.
