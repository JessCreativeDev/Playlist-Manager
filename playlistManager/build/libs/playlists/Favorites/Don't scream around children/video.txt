All too often I find adults assume children are ignoring them when they are yelling & screaming, often patronizing to the point of "they don't know what we're talking about." Just because children don't react, doesn't mean they don't understand or absorb. It isn't about whether or not you are cursing or playing mortal kombat or watching an action movie. It is about the way you interact with your children.
