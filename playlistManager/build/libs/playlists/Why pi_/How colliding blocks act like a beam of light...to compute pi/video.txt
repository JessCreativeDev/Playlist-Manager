Error correction: I wrote the answer as floor(pi/theta), when really it should be ceiling(pi/theta) - 1 t account for values of theta perfectly dividing pi.  For example, the case of equal masses gives an angle of pi/4, and 3 total clacks.

This beautiful result, and the solution shown here, are due to Gregory Galperin:

If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.
